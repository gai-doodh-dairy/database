# Database
Schema for the database. The Database is Cassandra and the query language is CQL.

In our specific case we had two datacenters following GossipPropertySnitch. The first datacenter had one rack and had 3 servers with replication factor 2 and the second server had two racks each with one server and both had a replication factor of 1

You will need to install the cassandra according to your planning.
